# twodivs

This is be a project to see how many designs I can make with just two divs. Maybe just a square and circle?

- HTML: i failed on calling this project "twodivs" beacuse i forgot about the wrapper and containers. ugh. but the point of two shapes is what i was going for.
- CSS: i'm getting more comfortable with the triangles. i feel like i don't have much consistency when it comes to the order of properties listed. i normally just put whatever i think of first as opposed to some structure. i will be more conscious of this for the next one.
- JS: i was VERY proud of myself for remembering how to make objects. it was a matter of getting them in an array that was confusing. after a brief search, i realized i was overthinking things and it was pretty straightforward. i almost remembered the syntax for a random number all from memory. i just forgot the parenthesis right after the random. ugh.

I spent a few days on this one because I wasn't feel well the past few days. Also, the prompt was kind of too open ended. I should have put either a time limit or finite number to reach. Having less structure in the prompt makes me kinda spiral everywhere. Anyway, I figured out picking random objects in an array so I'm satisfied. 11/30/18.
